        <p class="h2text">Getting Started</p>
        <p class="pratext">To begin playing Flappy Bird, download the game from your mobile app store. Once installed, open the game on your device, and you will see the main menu. Tap on the screen to start the game.</p>
        
        <p class="h2text">How to Play</p>
        <p class="h3text">Tap to Flap</p>
        <p class="pratext">Your primary control is tapping the screen. Each tap causes the bird to flap its wings and rise slightly. Once you stop tapping, the bird begins to fall due to gravity.</p>
        
        <p class="h3text">Timing Your Taps</p>
        <p class="pratext">The key to success in Flappy Bird is timing your taps. You need to tap at the right moments to ensure the bird flies through the openings in the pipes. If you tap too much or too little, you will collide with a pipe.</p>
        
        <p class="h3text">Maintain Your Focus</p>
        <p class="pratext">Flappy Bird requires concentration. The game can speed up as you progress, and the gaps between pipes can vary in size, making it essential to stay focused and adjust your tapping rhythm accordingly.</p>
        
        <p class="h3text">Score Points</p>
        <p class="pratext">You score a point for every set of pipes you successfully navigate through. The goal is to score as many points as possible before hitting a pipe.</p>
        
        <p class="h3text">Practice Makes Perfect</p>
        <p class="pratext">Flappy Bird is challenging, and it may take several tries to get a high score. Don’t get discouraged by frequent losses; instead, use them as opportunities to develop your timing and precision.</p>
        
        <p class="h2text">Tips for High Scores</p>
        <p class="pratext">Stay Calm: The game can be irritating, especially when you lose by a narrow margin. Staying calm and keeping a cool head will help you make better decisions and improve your performance.</p>
        <p class="pratext">Find a Rhythm: Some players find it helpful to get into a rhythm with their taps, as consistent tapping can help maintain a steady flight path.</p>
        <p class="pratext">Take Breaks: If you find yourself getting frustrated, take a break. Coming back to the game with fresh eyes can help you play better.</p>
        
        <p class="h2text">Conclusion</p>
        <p class="pratext">Flappy Bird is a test of patience and timing. While it may seem simple at first glance, its challenge lies in mastering the control you have over the bird’s flight. With practice and persistence, you can improve your skills and perhaps even earn an impressive high score to brag about.</p>
        <p class="pratext">Whether you're playing to beat your own best score or competing with friends, Flappy Bird offers endless entertainment and challenge. Ready to flap? Good luck, and happy gaming!</p>
